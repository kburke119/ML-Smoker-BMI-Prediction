## About

Our team's goal was to use machine learning to determine if a person is a smoker or non smoker based on the data points age, bmi, sex, and yearly hospital charges. 

[Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

Our dataset contained the following column headers:
- **age**: age of primary beneficiary
- **sex**: insurance contractor gender, female, male
- **bmi**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- **smoker**: smoker/non-smoker
- **region**: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Summary
- We started by cleaning the dataset with Python, Pandas, and Numpy.
